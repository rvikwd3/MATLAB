Write a function flipImage which flips an image either vertically or horizontally. The function
should take two parameters â€“ the matrix storing the image data and a flag to indicate
whether the image should be flipped vertically or horizontally. Use this function from the
command line to flip a given image both vertically and horizontally which should give the
following results.

Write a program that calculates the average intensity value of the pixels and then thresholds this image based on this intensity. Thresholding means that
a new image is generated in which each pixel has intensity 1.0 if the corresponding pixel in
the original image has a value above the threshold and 0 otherwise.

Write a program which generates the negative of an image. This means that a new image
is created in which the pixel values are all equal to 1.0 minus the pixel value in the original
image.

Write a computer program capable of reducing the number of intensity levels in an image
from 256 to 2 (in various integer powers of 2 i.e from 1 to 8). Try displaying all the images in
one figure to compare the difference (use subplot utility if you are using matlab).

Write a computer program capable of zooming and shrinking an image by pixel
replication. Assume that the desired zoom/shrink factors are integers. Take any image
and use your program to shrink the image by a factor of 10. Use your program to zoom
the image back to the resolution of the original. Explain the reasons for their differences.
